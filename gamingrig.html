                        <p>Now that the Covid19 virus hit the world in 2020 and with all the havoc and panic it caused, the prices of all commodities specially computer parts are up in the sky.  I wanna cry but we must not die! We got games to play! </p>
                        <p>Though I was employed that time at the government as a frontliner. I was able to save money for the gaming pc that I was dreaming about when I was still in college. Although, this is more like an upgrade of my old AMD APU PC.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid center2" src="./assets/img/oldpc.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">My old and trusted PC! Built year 2012.</span>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">"I built my PC in the Year of the Covid"</h2>
                        <p>I was able to sum up around PHP 60,000 cash and some PHP 20,000 for back up expenses. And then a fortunate oppurtunity came up, A guy posted in our local marketplace group that he was selling his pre-loved gaming as a bundle.   </p>
                        <p>I went to his place and checked the pc and other parts he was selling. All parts are 2 months old! *whistles* and he mentioned that he doesnt play games that much. I said to myself, "damn! I am really lucky that I was first to come here!</p>
                        <p>After all our negotation, we managed to close the deal. I bought his Auros Motherboard, Auros Memory 16gb, 128gb NVME storage for the OS and his Ryzen 5 Processor for only PHP 21,000! All item comes with its respective boxes! *omg*</p>
                        <p>With that deal, I'm currently missing a Power Supply, Casing, Hard drive, Monitor, Video Card and All-in-one cooler. Now, I am on the hunt! </p>
                        <p>I visited a local pc store in Davao, I bought an ATX Casing for PHP 3,100 and it comes along with 3 argb fans. A 1TB Harddrive for my files, music and movies it costed me PHP 2,100. A 550watts Power Supply for PHP 2,500. A gaming monitor! I bought an ASUS 144hz 24" Monitor for PHP 10,500! And lastly an AIO cooler, bought mine with 2 argb fans with it for PHP 3,200.</p>
                        <p>With the current situation back then with the Graphics Card shortage because of the cryptoboom, miners hoarded midrange and high end cards in the local and national market and that spiked the prices and lowered the supply in our stores nationally and locally.</p>
                        <p>I am really desperate to build my rig and you know what, Lady Luck is really on my side on the next day. A local gaming shop is selling their preloved RX580 Video Cards for only PHP 7,500. I visited their shop after I signed out of work and bought it! A lucky deal for me! Items sold out after 2 days!</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Setting the Machine up!</h2>
                        <p>Building and assembling is no sweat! The only hard part is the cable management process that took me half an hour to tidy things up in the side panel of the casing!</p>

                        <p>A couple of upgrades now and then, I bought a mechanical keyboard for PHP 3,100. A gaming mouse for PHP 900. Power Cable sleeves for PHP 600 through Shopee. A very long mousepad for PHP 500. And a gaming headset too for PHP 2,100.  </p>
